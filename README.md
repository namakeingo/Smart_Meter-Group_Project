# Smart Meter - Group Project

Group project done during my second year at The University Of Salford, during the Hack Camp following SCRUM methodologies. The application uses an external REST API to get all the data from a smart meter located at the "Salford University Energy House". It is designed following MVC, the back end is written in PHP and the fronted uses a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery

The project was developed using PHPStorm. Credit obviusly goes also to my team (I don't have their github to link)

Webside is hosted at http://smartmeter.altervista.org/
